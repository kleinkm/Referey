<H2 LANG="en-AU" CLASS="western">Description</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Referey
allows you to view your Mendeley (<A HREF="http://www.mendeley.com/">http://www.mendeley.com</A>)
database on your Android phone and open associated local files.
Please be aware that this is not an official Mendeley application!</P>
<P LANG="en-AU" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Referey expects the Mendeley SQLite database
and the associated files on the SD card or in your Dropbox. I decided against using 
the Mendeley Open API, as to my knowledge part of the database is not synchronised to the Mendeley Web
account and therefore not available via the API. This includes the
path of associated local files.</P>
<P LANG="en-AU" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Referey has the following functions:<BR>
- show reference list<BR>
- filter by collection or group<BR>
- filter by tags, authors, journal and publication date<BR>
- sort references<BR>
- search<BR>
- show reference details including notes and annotations (only the annotation text is shown)<BR>
- open associated files from SD card or Dropbox<BR>
- send file via email</P>
<P LANG="en-AU" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Your use of Referey
is at your sole risk. Referey is provided "as is" without expressed
or implied warranty of any kind.</P>
<P LANG="en-AU" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Since version 0.8.1, Referey opens the 
database with write-access for compatibility reasons. As this may change the "journal mode" of the 
database you should not sync the Referey database back to Mendeley Desktop.</P>
<P LANG="en-AU" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">I am aware that Referey's setup is not easy.
I may add a setup wizard in the future but due other commitments this
is unlikely to happen soon.</P>
<hr>
<H2 LANG="en-AU" CLASS="western">Preferences</H2>
<P LANG="en-AU" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The
preference screen can be opened by pressing the
menu key and choosing “Preferences”. The following options are
provided:</P>
<H3 LANG="en-AU" CLASS="western">Database path</H3>
<P CLASS="western">This is the path
where you have copied your SQLite database. The following
page describes how you can find the Mendeley database on your
computer:<BR><A HREF="http://www.mendeley.com/faq/#locate-database">http://www.mendeley.com/faq/#locate-database</A></P>
<P LANG="en-AU" CLASS="western">The filename is usually
„your_email@www.mendeley.com.sqlite“ or „online.sqlite“ if
you have not entered your email in Mendeley.</P>
<H3 LANG="en-AU" CLASS="western">PDF folder path</H3>
<P LANG="en-AU" CLASS="western">This is the path where
you have copied the files that are associated with your references.
These may include any file type. However, Referey opens these files
via an Intent so you need to have an application installed that can
display the associated file type.</P>
<H3 LANG="en-AU" CLASS="western">Preserve PDF path</H3>
<P LANG="en-AU" CLASS="western">As the directory
structure of the computer is different from an Android phone, Referey
has to convert the path of associated files. „Preserve PDF path“
indicates how many levels of the saved path in the SQLite database should be
preserved.</P>
<P LANG="en-AU" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; text-decoration: none">
<B>Example 1:</B></P>
<P CLASS="western">The associated
file has the following location on your
computer:<BR>C:\Users\name\Documents\References\example.pdf</P>
<P LANG="en-AU" CLASS="western">You have specified the
following PDF folder path in Referey: <BR>/sdcard/references</P>
<P LANG="en-AU" CLASS="western">Preserve PDF path is
set to: “file.pdf”</P>
<P LANG="en-AU" CLASS="western">Alternative PDF path conversion is not checked.</P>
<P LANG="en-AU" CLASS="western">Referey will then look
for the file at: <BR>/sdcard/references/example.pdf</P>
<P LANG="en-AU" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.2cm"><B>Example
2:</B></P>
<P LANG="en-AU" CLASS="western">The associated file has
the following location on your
computer:<BR>C:\Users\name\Documents\References\Collection_A\example.pdf</P>
<P LANG="en-AU" CLASS="western">You have specified the
following PDF folder path in Referey: <BR>/sdcard/references</P>
<P LANG="en-AU" CLASS="western">Preserve PDF path is
set to: „folder\file.pdf“</P>
<P LANG="en-AU" CLASS="western">Alternative PDF path conversion is not checked.</P>
<P LANG="en-AU" CLASS="western">Referey will then look
for the file at: <BR>/sdcard/references/Collection_A/example.pdf</P>
<H3 LANG="en-AU" CLASS="western">Alternative PDF path conversion</H3>
<P LANG="en-AU" CLASS="western">The path conversion as described above
should work fine for most users. However, if you do not rely on Mendeley's 
file organizer and if your PDF files are located in different folders with
different folder depth it will not work. In this case, you can use Referey's alternative path 
conversion method.</P>
<P LANG="en-AU" CLASS="western">Let's assume that you have PDF files on your computer located at
<BR>C:\Users\name\Documents\References\favourites\example1.pdf <i>and</i>
<BR>C:\Users\name\Documents\References\example2.pdf</P>
<P LANG="en-AU" CLASS="western">You have specified the
following PDF folder path in Referey: <BR>/sdcard/references</P>
<P LANG="en-AU" CLASS="western">Alternative PDF path conversion is checked.</P>
<P LANG="en-AU" CLASS="western">Remove PDF path is
set to: 4</P>
<P LANG="en-AU" CLASS="western">Referey will then remove the first 4 folder levels 
(Users\name\Documents\References) from the saved path and attached the rest to the
PDF folder path entered. So, Referey will look for the files at:
<BR>/sdcard/references/favourites/example1.pdf <i>and</i>
<BR>/sdcard/references/example2.pdf</P>
<P LANG="en-AU" CLASS="western">For Windows users: The drive letter will be
automatically removed and is not counted as a folder.</P>
<H3 LANG="en-AU" CLASS="western">Font size</H3>
<P LANG="en-AU" CLASS="western">This defines the font
size used in the main and details screen.</P>
<H3 LANG="en-AU" CLASS="western">Use dark theme</H3>
<P LANG="en-AU" CLASS="western">If this is selected a
black background will be used.</P>
<hr>
<H2 LANG="en-AU" CLASS="western">Main screen</H2>
<P LANG="en-AU" CLASS="western">The main screen shows a
list of your references. References shown in blue are unread. Yellow
indicates favourites and purple denotes favourite and unread (which
does not make much sense but is theoretically possible).</P>
<P LANG="en-AU" CLASS="western">You can select the
collection or group by tapping on the left side of the action bar. 
</P>
<P LANG="en-AU" CLASS="western">When you click on the
filter symbol a dialog will appear. You can select tags, authors,
the journal and the year of publication.
Referey will then only show the references that fulfil all these criteria.
A click on “Reset all” unselects all items. "Reset tab" only unselects the items
of the current tab.</P>
<P LANG="en-AU" CLASS="western">You can change the way
how Referey sorts your references by clicking on the symbol on the
right part of the action bar.</P>
<P LANG="en-AU" CLASS="western">A long tap anywhere on the action bar will
display the current filter criteria.</P>
<P LANG="en-AU" CLASS="western">The details screen can
be invoked by tapping on a reference.</P>
<P LANG="en-AU" CLASS="western">A long tap on a
reference opens the associated file.</P>
<hr>
<H2 CLASS="western">Search</H2>
<P LANG="en-AU" CLASS="western">Search can be invoked
by pressing the search key or by pressing the menu key and choosing
“Search”. The search is performed in the selected collection or
group. A search in “All documents” only searches in collections
and not in groups similarly to the original Mendeley Desktop program.
If several search terms are entered only references where all search
terms could be found are displayed. The search is performed in title, authors,
journal name, book title, abstract, year of publication, notes, annotations, 
tags and keywords. You can exit the search by
tapping on the search bar that shows up below the action bar.</P>
<hr>
<H2 LANG="en-AU" CLASS="western">Details screen</H2>
<P LANG="en-AU" CLASS="western">This screen shows the
details of the selected file including notes and annotations that you
have made in the PDF. However, only the annotation text and not the
actual position in the PDF is shown. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western">„Open File“
will try and open the associated file via an Intent. If more than one
file is associated you can choose a
file from a pop-up list. You need to have an application installed
that can display this file, for example a PDF reader. This works
for files that are saved locally on your computer and that have been
copied to the SD card of your phone.</P>
<P CLASS="western">„Send file“
allows you to send the associated file via email.</P>
<P CLASS="western">„Cancel“
returns to the main screen.</P>
<hr>
<H2 LANG="en-AU" CLASS="western">Dropbox support</H2>
<P LANG="en-AU" CLASS="western">Dropbox support is experimental and requires
that the <A HREF="http://market.android.com/details?id=com.dropbox.android">original Dropbox application</A>
is installed. If the associated files are located in your Dropbox please specify
the following "PDF folder path" in Preferences:<BR>dropbox://foldername</P>
<P LANG="en-AU" CLASS="western">Unfortunately, there is no documented way how Referey could inform the Dropbox application 
that it should refresh its file list. If Referey cannot find a file that was recently added, 
you may have to manually start the Dropbox application,
navigate to the folder with the associated files, press the menu key and choose "Refresh".</P>
<P LANG="en-AU" CLASS="western">If Referey has problems opening files from your Dropbox please enter the following information in your bug report or <A HREF="mailto:kleindev@gmx.de">email</A>: device model, Android version, Dropbox version. Otherwise I cannot try to reproduce the problem as it works fine on my phone.</P>
