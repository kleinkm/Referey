# Referey
Referey allows you to view your Mendeley (http://www.mendeley.com) database and open associated local files on your Android phone or from your Dropbox. Please be aware that this is not an official Mendeley application!
Referey expects the Mendeley SQLite database and the associated files on the SD card. Referey does not use the Mendeley Open API.
